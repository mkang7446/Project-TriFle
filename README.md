# Project - TriFLe

## Project Description 
> Stock market is really important nowadays. Not only it helps individuals or organizations earn a profit, but also just tracking stocks allows people to comprehend economic knowledge. In addition, you may just take a look at a company’s stock price for fun! This app is a stock tracking app, called TriFle (For your Financial Freedom), for people who want to manage their own stock portfolio and see the most recent news in the stock market. Users can see search results that show stock price and all information and then click on a specific company to see detail. Users also can add or remove the company on their portfolio so that they can simultaneously see all the interesting stocks which are located in a separate section. In the future, I want to add stock trading features so that users can actually buy and sell on the application.
